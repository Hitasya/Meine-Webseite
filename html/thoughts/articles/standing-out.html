              I apologize, in this draft, for not addressing your essay directly: your how's and the what's are things beyond a dropout's suggestions. However, they may be of value at addressing underlying matters, to challenge you to more holistically approach the application.

              I suppose there are millions of applicants who would transcend you on the grounds of mathematics as their primum mobile. The discerning factors would be  
              
              1)  your worldview, and  
              
              2) how you intend to align that with your enterprise by answering a certain question. 
              
               
              
              1) You have to distinguish between a statement coming from yourself rather than from ideology. 
              
               
              
              The objective view; 
              
              A rough heuristic would be that if you're saying something almost anyone else could say, then it's likely to be either clich√©d or ideological. If you were speaking from yourself, then in some sense, you're the only person who could be saying that. That would mean that you've taken ideas --- philosophical or even ideological --- and you've molded them to your idiosyncracy, so that you're speaking from a position only you can speak from, to have something original to offer.  
              
              You may have to try educating yourself out of your possession, because if anyone can predict what you're going to say on the basis of your set of beliefs, then you aren't speaking: your ideology is. And if the ideology is speaking, they don't even have to listen to you: they could just read about the ideology and make up their own mind, if they haven't already. 
              
               
              
              The subjective view; 
              
              Statements from yourself frighten you to some degree, because you actually open yourself up to the world by saying something genuine, but they also make you feel stronger because you're confronting your vulnerability:  
              
              In general you don your persona (a mask) and proclaim things you don't really believe so that criticism of those beliefs don't hurt you, because that persona isn't you.  
              
              However, if you say something you really, viscerally, believe, and then it gets criticized, then you've really put yourself on the line. What impedes the ability to be authentic (which, I surmise is what they look for among their faceless candidates) is a fear to have this integral part of you criticized, and yet confronting this aversion is means to the genuine strength and value you need to manifest yourself in the world, because while you shouldn't see yourself as a special thing, you're unique (just like everybody else), and people buy what's unique about you.  
              
              Brilliant thinking may be rare, but courage is more a modicum than genius.

              2) I think it's important to understand this to help aid you in answering an important question, one that aligns your beliefs [see above] with your trajectory as a human: that question is, "What important truth is unpopular?"  
              
              Most (bad) answers to this question are different ways of seeing the present (our education system is broken / capitalism is evil / government is futile); good answers come as close as we can to looking into the future --- and looking into the future is against conventional thought, because all too often, the things that are good for society are distinct from things that are seen as good by society. 
              
              Another thing to aid you in answering this: What does everybody agree on? If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what's hidden behind it. Now wouldn't that discern you from your competitor* applicants?  
              
              If you still can't answer it, Nietzsche reminds us: "Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, and ages, it is the rule".  
              
               
              
              As Jung said, it isn't perfection that a man should strive for, but completion. And by that time, you'll already have been dead. 
              
               
              
              
              
              
              
              * Though possibly unrelated, and yet consequential, I think that there's something to be said of our world that's obsessed with these zero sum games we idealize as 'healthy' competition....
