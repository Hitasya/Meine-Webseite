                <h4>Morality from the Gulags</h4>
                <p>In the 1838 play The Conspiracy, Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s character Cardinal Richelieu first coined the famous line, “the pen is mightier than the sword.” The adage is familiar to our ears and sounds convincing. Someone who has had the experience of sitting with pen and paper as armed security officers broke through the door would probably disagree. Unfortunately,</p>

                <h4>Children, please start fighting</h4>
                <p>When Wilbur and Orville Wright finished their flight at Kitty Hawk, Americans celebrated the brotherly bond. The brothers had grown up playing together, they had been in the newspaper business together, they had built an airplane together. They even said they “thought together.”
                    These are our images of creativity: filled with harmony. Innovation, we think, is something magical that happens when people find synchrony together. The melodies of Rodgers blend with the lyrics of Hammerstein. It’s why one of the cardinal rules of brainstorming is “withhold criticism.” You want people to build on one another’s ideas, not shoot them down. But that’s not how creativity really happens.</p>

                <h4>Towards a Type-1 Civilization</h4>
                <p>In a 1964 article on searching for extraterrestrial civilizations, the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev suggested using radio telescopes to detect energy signals from other solar systems in which there might be civilizations of three levels of advancement:</p>

                <h4>Pride vs Vanity</h4>
                <p> Alcibiades was a beloved pupil of Socrates, a favorite son of Athens, and an infamous betrayer of many peoples.

                    His conduct displayed many great inconsistencies and variations, not unnaturally, in accordance with the many and wonderful vicissitudes of his fortunes; but among the many strong passions of his real character, the one most prevailing of all was his ambition and desire of superiority.</p>
